# Image_captioning 

This model combines state of the art image classifier, VGG16 with RNN model built with skip-gram approach. 

## Objective 

Be sure to address:
•	What do you plan to do? 

I plan to implement two deep networks: CNN and RNN to build the multimodal RNN (MRNN). Image vectors are extracted from the penultimate layer (fc7, fully connected layer) in VGG16 and used as a initial state in RNN GRU nodes. 

•	Why is it important, and why is it challenging? 

•	What dataset(s) will you use?
•	What algorithms might you use? Are good implementations available, or will you need to write your own? (Don’t worry if you can’t answer this well at this stage of the course.)
•	References to at least four papers related to your proposal
